Welcome to the **Multiplayer AR Game Development** repository! This project (inspired by the course content below) will guide you through the basics of creating a multiplayer AR game using Unity, AR Foundation, and Photon Unity Networking (PUN 2).

## Overview

Multiplayer Augmented Reality (AR) games are becoming increasingly popular, especially with the advances in AR technology such as Google’s ARCore, Apple’s ARKit, Microsoft HoloLens, and Magic Leap. This repository focuses on building a foundation for **Multiplayer AR** experiences, combining:

- **Unity** for game development
- **Photon Unity Networking (PUN 2)** for multiplayer functionality
- **ARCore** (Android) and **ARKit** (iOS) through **AR Foundation** for augmented reality

By the end of this project (or course), you’ll have a functioning multiplayer AR game demo that you can deploy on both iOS and Android devices.

## Requirements / Prerequisites

- **ARCore-supported** Android phone
- **ARKit-supported** iPhone or iPad
- **Unity** (2019.3 or later recommended)
- **Intermediate C# experience**
- **Beginner-Intermediate Unity experience**

> **Note:** Always ensure your Unity version supports the AR Foundation package you plan to use.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. **Open the project** in Unity (2019.3+ recommended).
3. **Install packages** via the Package Manager (if not already included):
    - AR Foundation
    - ARCore XR Plugin (for Android)
    - ARKit XR Plugin (for iOS)
    - Photon Unity Networking (PUN 2)
4. **Project Settings**:
    - Make sure the correct **XR Plug-in Management** is enabled for your target platforms (Android or iOS).
    - Confirm you have the right **Scripting Runtime** set up in Unity’s Player Settings (usually .NET 4.x).
5. **Build & Run**:
    - For **Android**: Switch to the Android platform in Unity, enable ARCore in XR Plug-in Management, and build.
    - For **iOS**: Switch to the iOS platform, enable ARKit in XR Plug-in Management, and build.
6. **Testing**:
    - Ensure that your test device supports ARCore or ARKit.
    - Once the app is installed, move the device around to detect surfaces and place your AR game arena.
    - For **multiplayer**, ensure you have an active internet connection and that Photon services are correctly configured (App ID, region, etc.).

## Roadmap / Future Enhancements

- **Advanced AR interactions**: Gestures, object manipulation, shared anchors, etc.
- **Matchmaking & lobby systems**: Create or join rooms by custom criteria.
- **Cross-platform play**: Ensure seamless interaction between Android and iOS users.
- **In-game chat or voice communication**: Real-time messaging or voice channels.
